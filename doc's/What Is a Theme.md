# What Is a Theme ?

- A WordPress theme represents the **design** of your website.
- It can control everything from **colors**, to **fonts**, to the **entire layout**. 
- In essence, what you see when viewing the front-end of your site is shaped by the theme.

### What can themes do?
- Themes take the content stored by WordPress and display it in the browser
- When you create a WordPress theme, you decide how that content looks and is displayed

### Block themes
- Block themes are the modern method of building WordPress themes
- Block themes rely on **HTML**-based block templates that contain block markup
- Both creators and users can edit the templates in the **Site Editor**
- Users can also customize **global settings** and **styles** defined by the theme’s **theme.json** file through the Styles interface.
- Technically, you cannot create a new theme from scratch entirely from the editor, but you can modify the templates and styles of an existing theme—in essence, creating a custom theme of your own. 

### What are themes made of?
- Templates (.html in block themes and .php in classic themes)
- CSS Stylesheets
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Media (images, audio, video, etc.)
- JSON

### What is the difference between themes and plugins?
- Themes control the presentation of content.
- Plugins control the behaviors and features of your site.
